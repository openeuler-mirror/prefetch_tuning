# Prefetch Tuning

This kernel module is based on Kunpeng chip and provides some performance-sensitive chip parameters for adjustment.

## Environment

- Hardware: Based on HiSilicon Kunpeng 920 (only support 920a for now)

- OS: EulerOS or openEuler

## Build and install

```
make clean && make
insmod prefetch_tuning.ko
```

To confirm the kernel module is installed successfully:

```
lsmod | grep prefetch_tuning
```

The maximum value of outstanding can be 5 when the TaiShan core is used. Otherwise, overflow errors occur. Note 2: The SMMU cannot match the Dvmsnp outstanding value 5. Therefore, you need to set the switch to 3 for Totem and Infinite of 1383. Totem and Nimbus of 1620: Set DVM outstanding to 5. However, do not configure POE for the DVMSNP broadcast node. The POE uses a private page table and does not require DVMSNP. | 0 ~ 15(Note: 0 represents that outstanding level is 1)

The maximum value of outstanding can be 9 when there are four chips. Otherwise, an overflow error occurs. Note 2: In the case of two chips, the maximum outstanding value of totem can be 10, and the maximum outstanding value of nimbus or infinite is 24. This ensures the best performance. Note 3: In the case of a single chip, there is no restriction on the outstanding configuration of the totem. | 0 ~ 31(Note: 0 represents that outstanding level is 1) |
| dvmsnp_perf_en | Whether to enable the outstanding level for the dvmsnp.(Note: After the function is enabled, the dvmsnp outstanding value of the MN is equal to the value of dvmsnp_outstanding.) | 0 (disable), 1 (enable) |

## Configuration Method

Configurate the specific paramters like this:

```

To confirm whether the configuration is valid or not, use `cat` like this:

```
cat /sys/class/misc/prefetch/policy
```

## Uninstall

```
